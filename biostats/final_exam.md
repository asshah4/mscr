# Question 1

Blood-pressure measurements taken on the left and right arms of a person are assumed to be comparable.  To test this assumption, 40 people are randomly sampled, and systolic blood-pressure (SBP) readings are taken simultaneously on both arms by two observers.  Assume that the two observers are comparable in skill and experience, and assume that left arm SBP, right arm SBP, and the difference between left and right arm SBP are all symmetric but distinctly non-normal.

- assumption is left/right arms have same blood pressure in a person
- sample is from 40 pts at random
- simultaneously measures are taken of BP
- three variables are created: left arm, right arm, and difference between both arms
- null hypothesis would be the difference b/w arms is 0
- non-normal distribution, but n = 40
- one-sample is given

The most appropriate procedure for testing whether or not the two arms give comparable results is:

__One Sample T-test__ based on M&M guidelines for $N \geq 40$.

# Question 2

Weight loss was recorded for a random sample of 10 people who had been taking a weight-loss drug.  The population of weight losses is likely to be strongly skewed.

- sample size is 10 people
- one-sample description
- true mean is known

The most appropriate procedure for testing whether the true average weight loss is greater than 10 lbs is: 

__Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test__ is most appropriate as population is skewed/non-normal ($N \leq 10$). 

# Question 3

Investigators measured the before-breakfast plasma citrate concentrations for 110 randomly sampled people.  The average was $119 \mumol/l$.  Suppose that plasma citrate concentrations are known to follow a normal distribution.

- sample of 110 (satisfying M&M guidelines for normal as well)
- one sample testing
- SD/variance is unknown however

The most appropriate procedure for testing whether the true average before-breakfast plasma citrate concentration for the population is greater than $115 \mumol/l$ is:

__One-Sample T-test__ as the distribution is normal, but the sigma is unknown.

# Question 4

A study was conducted to analyze the relationship between vasectomies and prostate cancer.  It was found that 7 out of 2130 randomly sampled men who had not had a vasectomy had prostate cancer, while, in an independent random sample, 11 out of 2200 men with vasectomies had prostate cancer.

- comparing two populations (no vasectomies versus vasectomies)
- large sample sizes in both groups
- proportion of outcome/event is known in both
- H0: prostate cancer risk is similar without or with vasectomy

The most appropriate hypothesis test method for analyzing the relationship of interest is:

__Chi-square test of homogeneity__ as there are two independent random samples from each population (vasectomy or not).
